- 👷 I am the committer of [Chaos Mesh](https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh), the powerful chaos engineering platform based on Kubernetes.
- ✍️ I write [blog](https://strrl.dev) and build [knowledge base](https://whatiknown.strrl.dev).
- 🌱 I am trying to take more efforts on contributing upstream projects like [kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) and [controller-runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime).
- 🤩 I am crazy about these things:
  - Serverless
  - Cloud Computing
  - Full-Stack Development
- 🔭 I love to collect amazing ideas and implement them:
  - [what-does-dodo-says](https://github.com/dodo-says/what-does-dodo-say): co-chair committee auditable anonymous forums.
  - [kube-image](https://github.com/strrl/kubectl-image): docker image but for kubernetes.
  - factorio-automata: A robot that could play [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/) without any of human intervention.
  - [homelab-cloud-controller-manager](https://github.com/STRRL/homelab-cloud-controller-manager): the simple cloud controller manager for homelab. (Archived, use [metallb](https://github.com/metallb/metallb) as instead.)
